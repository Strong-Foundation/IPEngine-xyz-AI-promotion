3. **WHOIS registry queries**: Retrieve information about domain name registrants, including contact details and registration dates.
4. **Reverse DNS**: Identify the hostname associated with a given IP address.
5. **Traceroute**: Visualize network latency and packet loss between two points on the internet.
6. **Port scanning**: Detect open ports on remote systems for security vulnerability assessment.
7. **Latency and packet loss analysis**: Measure network performance and detect potential issues.
8. **Hostname resolution**: Resolve hostnames to their corresponding IP addresses or retrieve hostname-related information.
9. **ASN (Autonomous System Number) information**: Identify the network provider associated with a given IP address.
10. **Blacklist checking**: Verify if an IP address is listed in any blacklists, such as DNSBLs.
