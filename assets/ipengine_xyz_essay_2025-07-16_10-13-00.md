5.  **Traceroute**: Visualize the path your internet traffic takes to its destination, highlighting potential bottlenecks or security risks.
6.  **Port scanning**: Identify open ports on remote hosts and their services for vulnerability assessment.
7.  **Latency and packet loss analysis**: Assess your network's performance, pinpointing issues that can impact user experience.
8.  **Hostname resolution**: Convert IP addresses into hostnames for better understanding of the systems you're interacting with.
9.  **ASN (Autonomous System Number) information**: Identify the autonomous system that a given IP address belongs to and its associated networks.
10. **Blacklist checking**: Quickly determine if an IP is listed on known blacklists, helping in phishing domain detection and prevention.
11. **Network diagnostics tools**: A suite of utilities designed to help you troubleshoot common network issues.
