3.  **Remote worker troubleshoots VPN packet loss**: Rachel, a remote worker using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure access, faces frustrating packet loss issues. IPEngine's network diagnostics tools enable her to pinpoint the source of the problem: a faulty router at her VPN provider's end. With IPEngine's guidance, Rachel resolves the issue and continues working seamlessly.
4.  **Small business owner monitors DNS uptime and anomalies**: Alex, the owner of a small e-commerce business, relies on IPEngine to monitor his website's DNS uptime and detect potential security threats.
