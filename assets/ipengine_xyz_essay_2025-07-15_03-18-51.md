🔍 **IP geolocation lookup**: Identify where devices are connected from and ensure compliance with data residency regulations.
💻 **DNS record resolution** (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT): Troubleshoot DNS propagation issues, detect phishing domains, and verify website ownership.
🕵️‍♂️ **WHOIS registry queries**: Uncover domain registrant information, track down malicious actors, and investigate suspicious websites.
🔄 **Reverse DNS**: Reverse lookup IP addresses to identify hostname mismatches or abuse cases.
🚀 **Traceroute**: Map network hops between devices for detailed latency analysis and packet loss detection.
💻 **Port scanning**: Discover open ports, detect common vulnerabilities, and prioritize patching efforts.
📡 **Latency and packet loss analysis**: Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize network resources.
🔍 **Hostname resolution**: Verify domain name server (DNS) records and ensure correct DNS configuration.
👥 **ASN information**: Determine the Autonomous System Number (ASN) for IP addresses and organizations.
⚠️ **Blacklist checking**: Warn against malicious IPs, detect spam sources, and block known threats.
